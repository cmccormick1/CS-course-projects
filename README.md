# CS-course-projects

**THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING FUTURE EMPLOYMENT, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY ACADEMIC PURPOSES!!!**

This repository contains projects from my past Computer Science courses. It is broken into three sections: 1) programs written in Java, 2) programs written in Python, and 3) programs to do with cloud computing.

Included in the Java and Python sections are one non-object-oriented program, one object-oriented program, and readmes explaining the nature of the project (i.e. the motivation/purpose, executing instructions, etc.).
