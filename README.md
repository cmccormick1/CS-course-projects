!!Note: This repository is for the purpose of securing future employment, and it should not be used for any academic purposes!!

This repository contains projects from my past Computer Science courses. It is broken into two sections: programs written in Java and programs written in Python.

Included in each section are one non-object-oriented program, one object-oriented program, and readmes explaining the nature of the program (i.e. the motivation/purpose, executing instructions, etc.).
