# CS-course-projects

**THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING FUTURE EMPLOYMENT, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY ACADEMIC PURPOSES!!**

This repository contains projects from my past Computer Science courses. It is broken into two sections: programs written in Java and programs written in Python.

Included in each section are one non-object-oriented program, one object-oriented program, and readmes explaining the nature of the project (i.e. the motivation/purpose, executing instructions, etc.).
