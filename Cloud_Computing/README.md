**README for server.py**

**Author**: Caroline McCormick\
**Course:** CSC 346, Fall 2020\
**Purpose:** server.py acts as a multi-threaded, HTTP server for an HTTP client.\
         It takes two command line parameters: "port" and "dir_path." "port" is\
         the port number you want it to serve on, and "dir_path" is the directory\
         in which the file you want to serve resides.

**Usage:** python3 server.py port dir_path\
    e.g.:
     * port --> 8080\
     * dir_path --> ../Cloud_Computing/Second_Website/
