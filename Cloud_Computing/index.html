<p>In the Universe there are many different types of stars. One way astronomers classify 
stars is by putting them on the Hertzsprung-Russell ("H-R") diagram (image on the right). 
This diagram allows stars to be classified by their luminosity, which is essentially their 
brightness, and their temperature. While many properties of stars can be inferred from the 
H-R diagram, this web page will focus on the three main evolutionary classifications of 
stars that that H-R diagram displays: the main sequence, giants/supergiants, and white dwarfs.</p>

<p><b>Main Sequence</b>
<br>The main sequence is where a star spends most of its life. As seen in the H-R diagram, 
the main sequence spans a large range of luminosities and temperatures. Where a star lands 
on the main sequence is dependent on its mass, composition, and other inherent factors. One
special star to Earth, <a href="sun.html">the Sun</a>, lands on the main sequence with a 
temperature of about 5800 K and 1 solar luminosity. 
</p>

<p><b>Giants/Supergiants</b>
<br>A star that is classified as a giant or a supergiant is one that has evolved off of 
the main sequence after a really long time and has puffed up its outer layers to a great 
extent. Not all stars become a giant or supergiant, but for the ones that do, this stage 
can be thought of as the beginning of the end of its life. Giants and supergiants are, as
the names imply, very large stars that are very luminous. The star Betelgeuse in the Orion
constellation is a well-known example of a red supergiant.
</p>

<p><b>White Dwarfs</b>
<br> White dwarfs are the final fate for some stars that have made it to the giant/supergiant
branch. Once these giant/supergiant stars puff up their outer layers so far, they will lose
all of that material, so that all that's left is the dense core of the star--i.e. the white
dwarf. The white dwarf will then gradually get cooler and eventually die.

<br>The table below shows stars in our night sky that are the brightest, closest, and largest.
