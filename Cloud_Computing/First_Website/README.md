**README for proj01: HTML**

**Author:** Caroline McCormick\
**Course:** CSC 346, Fall 2020\
**Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to learn HTML and to make two related\
              webpages connected by a link within the text. I made a web page about\
              stellar evolution and linked another page specifically about the Sun.
         
**Files:**
   * index.html --> this is the main web page about stellar evolution.
   * sun.html --> this is the secondary page specifically about the Sun.
   * HRDiagram.jpg --> HR diagram image included in index.html.
   * SunUV.jpg --> image of the Sun included in sun.html.
   * SunUV2.jpg --> second image of the Sun included in sun.html.
   * Visual/final_website_pg1.PNG --> what the stellar evolution page looks like in a browser.
   * Visual/final_website_pg2.PNG --> what the Sun page looks like in a browser.
