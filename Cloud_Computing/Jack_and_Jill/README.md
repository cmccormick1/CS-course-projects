**README for proj03: Jack and Jill game**

**Author:** Caroline McCormick\
**Course:** CSC 346, Fall 2020\
**Purpose:** The Jack and Jill game allows a user to send Jack and Jill up the hill by clicking on a button on the\
         web page. Each time Jack and Jill are sent up the hill, they roll back down and take damage; Jill can\
         heal some of her damage. They each take the same amount of damage, and they can take between 1 and 20\
         hit points per turn. Jill can heal between 1 and the number of damage points per turn. The user keeps\
         playing until at least one person's health is less than or equal to zero. Once this happens, the\
         button on the page says "Start game over."
